# CoreFunctionality

## What is spigot?
A spigot plugin is an add-on for a game server. This game server called Spigot is a modified Minecraft server which provides functionality for these plugins as well as extras.
> This provides additional performance optimizations, configuration options and features, whilst still remaining consistent with Vanilla Minecraft game mechanics.

## What is Core Functionality?
Core Functionality is a big project I set myself to complete as part of a personal project unit whilst at college/university.
It is a working plugin (unless updates have broken it) and does require a few others to work fully (such as vault and citizens for the shops)

The plugin offers a huge range of commands and features that can be enabled or disabled depending on the users preference. It contains the following modules:
```
AFK
> Simple away from keyboard handling (prevents damage whilst in an "AFK" state)
Chat
> Chat formatting section, handles tags from groups and chat colour
Combat
> Helps prevent issues like combat logging (leaving the game whilst in combat)
Groups
> More commonly known as ranks - Permission based system with tags and inheritance
Home
> Simple module to allow setting of a home location which can be teleported to
Moderation
> Re-work of common moderation commands (Ban, kick, kill, mute, etc.)
Referrals
> System that rewards players for bringing friends onto the server
Security
> Simple system to prevent too many accounts on the same IP address
Shops
> Whole shop system with NPCs and inventory based trading
Spawn
> Allows a world spawn to be set which can be teleported to by anyone
Teleportation
> Player based teleportation - Force TP for staff and request TP for players
Utility
> Huge range of utility based commands. To list a few: broadcase, enchant, fly, gamemode, message and heal
Warps
> Allows creation of "warps" in the world which can be teleported 
```

There are definitely improvements that can be done, the plugin is also not perfect (more could be added, there are a few inconsitencies, etc.) but I believe it displays a range of great skills when it comes to object orientated programming and spigot development.
